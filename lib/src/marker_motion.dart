/// - [animation]: Uses an [AnimationController] for smooth, curve-based transitions.
/// - [timer]: Uses a [Timer] for step-based updates, offering a simpler alternative.

/// A widget that smoothly animates Google Maps markers between two positions.
///
/// [MarkerMotion] animates markers from their previous positions to new ones
/// whenever the provided [markers] set changes. It’s ideal for applications
/// where map markers need to move dynamically, such as tracking real-time
/// locations or updating points of interest.
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// MarkerMotion(
///   markers: mapMarkers, // Set of Marker objects to animate
///   duration: const Duration(milliseconds: 5200),
///   builder: (markers) {
///     return GoogleMap(
///       markers: markers,
///     );
///   },
/// )
/// ```
